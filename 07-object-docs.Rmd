# Object Documentation {#object_docs}

Documentation is one of the most important aspects of a good package. Without it, users won’t know how to use your package. Documentation is also useful for collaborating developers, and the future-you (so you remember what your functions were supposed to do), looking to extend your package.

There are multiple forms of documentation. In this chapter, you’ll learn about object documentation, as accessed by `?` or `help()`. Object documentation is a string literal specified in source code that is used, like a comment, to document a specific segment of code. The three main types of object documentation we'll illustrate in this chapter are:

- __Package-level documentation__: Top level description for what your package does and can point users to additional resources if necessary.
- __Module-level documentation__: More common in `r fontawesome::fa("python")` than `r fontawesome::fa("r-project")` and helps to describe the purpose and contents of an individual module within a package.
- __Function-level documentation__: The function documentation that you have already been exposed to in earlier chapters.

```{block, type='tip'}
We are advocates for documenting as much as possible. It may slow you down initially but over the longterm it will speed up the development and maintenance process of a package.
```


## `r fontawesome::fa("r-project")` example

R object documentation is generated from the `.Rd` files in the `man/` directory. If you look at one of the current `.Rd` files in your package's `man/` directory you'll see LaTeX-like syntax. However, properly writing the `.Rd` files can be burdensome so we use [roxygen2](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/) to automate this process. Plus, it allows us to include documentation directly with our functionality. The sections that follow will illustrate the most common uses of roxygen2.

### Package-level documentation

You can use roxygen to provide a help page for your package as a whole. This is accessed with `package?pkg_name` (when the package is not loaded) or with `?pkg_name` when it is loaded, and can be used to describe the most important components of your package. 

There’s no object that corresponds to a package, so you need to document `NULL`, and then manually label it with `@docType package` and `@name <package-name>`. This is also an excellent place to use the `@section` tag to divide up the page into useful categories. For example, you can include the following package documentation in a file called `<package-name>.R`:

```{block, type='tip'}
The `\@section` tag allows you to create as many arbitrary sections as necessary.
```


```{r, eval=FALSE}
#' myfirstpkg: A simple package to teach myself how to develop R packages..
#'
#' The myfirstpkg: package provides X categories of important functions:
#' foo, bar and baz.
#'
#' @section Foo functions:
#' The foo functions ...
#'
#' @section Boo functions:
#' The bar functions ...
#'
#' @section Baz functions:
#' The baz functions ...
#'
#' @section Learn more:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item \href{https://some.url.com}{Vignettes} Detailed example implementations.
#'   \item \href{https://some.url.com}{Source code} Dig into the source code.
#' }
#'
#' @section Author(s):
#' \strong{Maintainer}: Brad Boehmke \email{bradleyboehmke@gmail.com}
#'
#' Authors:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item John Doe
#'   \item Jane Doe
#' }
#'
#' Other contributors:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item Sally Mae
#'   \item Paul Smith
#' }
#'
#' @docType package
#' @name myfirstpkg
NULL
#> NULL
```

Now if do the following:

1. `devtools::document()`: to add a `.Rd` file for the package,
2. `devtools::load_all()`: to load the package contents,
3. `?myfirstpkg`: to access the package help documentation

You'll see the following in the __Help__ window:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/r-pkg-docs.png")
```

### Module-level documentation

Documentating individual `.R` scripts (i.e. modules) is not common among R developers and, unlike Python, there is no formal approach to do this. However, as your package expands it is not uncommon for individual source code scripts to become long and contain many functions and/or classes. When this happens, it can be helpful to document the scripts to explain the purpose of the script (remember, you should be grouping like items within a script) and the functions/class it contains.

To do this in `r fontawesome::fa("r-project")` you would just use comment blocks. For example, you could add the following to the top of the `summary-stats.R` script to provide a synopsis of the intent and contents of the scripts. 

```{block, type="tip"}
Use Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R to add the `# Some lable ----------` comment blocks.
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Description ---------------------------------------------------------------------

# Primary interface for summary statistics functionality
#
# A longer description can go here if greater details needs to be
# provided that span multiple lines.
#
# Available classes:
# - NA
#
# Available functions:
# - z_score: Computes z-score of a numeric/logical vector.
# - my_sd: Computes standard deviation of a numeric/logical vector.
# - my_mean: Computes arithmentic mean of a numeric/logical vector.


# Source code ---------------------------------------------------------------------
...
```

### Function-level documentation

Functions are the most commonly, and most important, documented object. As well as the introduction block, most functions have at least three tags: 

* __`@param`__: Describes the function’s inputs or parameters. The description should provide a succinct summary of the type of the parameter (e.g., string, numeric vector) and, if not obvious from the name, what the parameter does. All parameters must be documented otherwise you will receive warnings when running `devtools::check()`.

* __`@examples`__: Provides executable R code showing how to use the function in practice. This is a very important part of the documentation because many people look at the examples first. For the purpose of illustration, it’s often useful to include code that causes an error. Or sometimes you may have examples that have other dependencies (i.e. creating a Spark environment). Wrapping your example(s) with `\dontrun{}` allows you to include code in the example that is not run.

* __`@return`__: Describes the output from the function. This is not necessary but it is a good idea to always include it so it is clear to the consumer what to expect as output. This becomes even more important when your output type differs from your input type (i.e. input is a data frame but the output is a vector).

We have already seen all three of these in action with our current `my_mean()` documentation:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#' Mean of a vector
#'
#' @description
#' Computes arithmetic mean of a vector with numeric or logical values.
#'
#' @param x A numeric or logical vector.
#' @param na.rm Boolean specifying whether or not to remove NA and NaN values..
#' @param inf.rm Boolean specifying whether or not to remove Inf values.
#'
#' @return
#' The arithmetic mean of the values in x returned as a numeric vector of length one.
#'
#' @examples
#' x <- 1:10
#' my_mean(x)
#'
#' @export
my_mean <- function(x, na.rm = TRUE, inf.rm = TRUE) {
  validate_numeric_vector(x)
  x <- validate_special_values(x, na.rm, inf.rm)
  total <- sum(x)
  units <- length(x)
  return(total / units)
}
```

### Additional syntax

There are many additional syntax improvements you can make to your documentation. For example, you can 

- make text italicized, bold or formatted as code,
- cross reference other documentation within the package,
- hyperlink to websites,
- include unordered and ordered lists,
- include math equations,
- and much more.

```{block, type="tip"}
See [here](https://r-pkgs.org/man.html#text-formatting) for a quick reference guide of different documentation syntax formatting.
