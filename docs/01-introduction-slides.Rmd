# What are packages?

* Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R and Python code. 

* They include reusable components, the documentation that describes how to use them, requirements to ensure the user can apply them and tests to ensure consistent and reliable functionality.


```{block, type='note'}
.font80[
People often use the terms "package" and "library" synonymously.

- __package__: generally refers to source code that is bundled up in a way that a package manager can host. [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) and [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) are the two primary public package managers for Python and R. When you `pip install pkg` (Python) or `install.packages("pkg")` (R) you are installing the __pkg__ package from a package manager onto a computer.

- __library__: generally refers to a centralized location on an operating system where installed package source code resides and can be imported into a current session (i.e. /usr/lib/R/library).  When you use `pip list` (Python) or `installed.packages()` (R) you will see a list of _installed_ packages, which we refer to as libraries. When you run `sys.path` (Python) or `.libPaths()` (R) you will get the path to the library where your installed packages are stored.

# Package name

- Easy to remember

- Follow the respective languages idiomatic approach to naming

- Should not already exist.

- Certain requirements we need to adhere to
  - `r fontawesome::fa("r-project")` your name can contain a `.` but not a `-` or `_`
  - `r fontawesome::fa("python")` your name can contain all three but not recommended
  - In both languages you can combine upper and lowercase letters in the name.

- Examples of good names:
  - numpy
  - dplyr
  - pandas
  - keras

---
# Package structure

Where will the package live on your operating system?

- Should be distinct from where installed packages live

- Typically designate a directory inside their home directory for `r fontawesome::fa("r-project")` and `r fontawesome::fa("python")` (source) packages

- E.g. `~/Desktop/Packages/` or `/r/packages` and `/python/packages`

```{block, type = "note"}
There are manual approaches to create the initial package structure but we'll use a tool to help automate this procedure. We'll cover this within our working examples.
```

---
# Enable version control

.scrollable90[
Most package development never resides solely on one operating system nor with only one developer.

- [GitHub](https://github.com/), 
- [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/), 
- [Azure Repos](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/repos/)

.bold[Step 1]: connect our local git repository to a remote repository so we can push, pull, and merge updates we make to the package

.bold[Step 2]: set up a proper branching method for our work

- __master__ branch is the "production" release branch.
- __develop__ branch is the main branch where the source code always reflects a state with the latest delivered development changes for the next release.
- __supporting branches__ are the branches where we do the majority of our work. These are the branches where we create new fixtures, fix bugs, improve documentation.

```{block, type='tip'}
If you are unfamiliar with git and branching then we recommend these tutorials to get started:

- [Understanding the GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
- [A successful Git branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
```
]

---
# Virtual environments

- Virtual environments create an isolated environment for our project

- Each project can have its own dependencies, regardless of what dependencies every other project has

- Creates better reliability during the development process.

```{block, type='tip'}
.bold[It is a best practice to always do your development work in virtual environments.] To learn more about virtual environments we suggest starting with the following tutorials:

- [Python Virtual Environments: A Primer](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/)
- [renv: Project Environments for R](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html)
```

---
# Add new functionality

.scrollable90[

When adding new functionality we recommend following a .bold[test-driven development] (TDD) approach

1. __Add a test__: In TDD, each new feature or bug fix begins with writing a test. This test defines a function, improvements of a function, or a case in which a function results in a bug.
2. __Run test(s) and make sure the new test fails__: Before writing any source code, run the new test to ensure that it fails.
3. __Write the code__: The next step is to write some code that causes the test to pass. The new code written at this stage is not perfect and may, for example, pass the test in an inelegant way. That is acceptable because it will be improved and honed in Step 5.
4. __Run tests__: If all test cases now pass, the programmer can be confident that the new code meets the test requirements, and does not break or degrade any existing features. If they do not, the new code must be adjusted until they do.
5. __Refactor code__: Once the source code passes the test, you should spend time refactoring and cleaning it up. A growing code base can quickly get out of control. This step ensures you take the time to reduce [tech debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt).
6. __Repeat__: Starting with another new test, the cycle is then repeated to push forward the functionality of the source code.

```{block, type='tip'}
If you are interested in learning more about the TDD philosophy we recommend the following books:

- [The Pragramatic Programmer](https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-journey-mastery-Anniversary/dp/0135957052/ref=dp_ob_title_bk) (Ch. 41)
- [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/ref=pd_bxgy_img_2/134-3713013-8748161?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=0132350882&pd_rd_r=c66a8eb8-13a3-4246-bf5c-47bff29f3be6&pd_rd_w=m2kCB&pd_rd_wg=NqeJv&pf_rd_p=4e3f7fc3-00c8-46a6-a4db-8457e6319578&pf_rd_r=R46745MCZ1C0V1ZD3QS4&psc=1&refRID=R46745MCZ1C0V1ZD3QS4) (Ch. 9)
- [Test Driven Development](https://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-Kent-Beck/dp/0321146530)
```

]

---
# Document

Once your new functionality is successfully passing tests and has been refactored, you should make sure any necessary documentation is added or updated:

- function specific documentation, 

- module level documentation, 

- any code in example notebooks or vignettes,

- package website

---
# Version control

Lastly, we need to now save our work to our remote repository. This typically includes:

- staging, 

- commiting and 

- pushing our changes. 

- Depending on the stage of our work we may be ready to do a pull request into the main development branch.

We advise using a [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) approach 

`<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>` (i.e. 0.9.1, 1.4.0)

- `<MAJOR>` version when you make incompatible API changes. This signals that your updates will likely effect many users and will cause breaking changes to users' prior code. 
- `<MINOR>` version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner. This often includes adding a new feature that does not effect the existing code base.
- `<PATCH>` version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

The License field can be either a standard abbreviation for an open source license, like GPL-2 or BSD, or a pointer to a file containing more information, file `LICENSE`.

- [MIT](https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license): This is a simple and permissive license. It lets people use and freely distribute your code subject to only one restriction: the license must always be distributed with the code.
- [GPL-2](https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-general-public-license-v2) or [GPL-3](https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-general-public-license-v3-(gpl-3)): These are “copy-left” licenses. This means that anyone who distributes your code in a bundle must license the whole bundle in a GPL-compatible way. Additionally, anyone who distributes modified versions of your code (derivative works) must also make the source code available. GPL-3 is a little stricter than GPL-2, closing some older loopholes.
- [CC0](https://tldrlegal.com/license/creative-commons-cc0-1.0-universal): It relinquishes all your rights on the code and data so that it can be freely used by anyone for any purpose. This is sometimes called putting it in the public domain, a term which is neither well-defined nor meaningful in all countries.

```{block, type='tip'}
If you’d like to learn more about other common licenses, Github’s [choosealicense.com](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/) is a good place to start. Another good resource is https://tldrlegal.com/, which explains the most important parts of each license.

It is common to include URLs to direct users to:

- Where the source code resides (i.e. Github repo)
- Where to post bugs, feature requests, etc. (i.e. Github issues)

We may also want to point people to a package documentation website, the changelog, or other URLs that host important package information.
