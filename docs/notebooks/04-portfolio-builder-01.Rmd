<br>

1. Work through the R and Python workflow examples to create your first R and Python
packages. Be sure to implement all of the steps.

2. Now create 3 new functions to add to the package. These can be simple functions that
recreate existing functionality in R and Python or they can be functions that you 
developed in other modules.

3. After you've completed #1 & #2, commit your work to Github (this should be done in
a feature branch) and do a pull request from the feature branch to the develop branch. Be
sure to add at least two classmates as reviewers to your pull request.

4. In addition to completing your own pull request, review and provide feedback to at
least two other classmates pull requests.
