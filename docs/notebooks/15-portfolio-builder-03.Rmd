Documentation is usually an area that every package could improve upon. For this portfolio builder, seek out both R and Python packages where you have identified needed improvements in any of the following:

- README
- Changelog
- Object documentation
- Test documentation
- Long-form documentation (i.e. tutorials)
- Package website

Be sure to follow the suggested development workflow of:

1. forking the repository
2. creating a new feature branch
3. build out the solution
4. make a pull request

The following represent collections of R and Python packages that could be good places to start in identifying good first issues for documentation but feel free to explore Github for other options.
