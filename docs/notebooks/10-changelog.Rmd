A changelog is a file which contains a curated, chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version of a project. A good changelog gives you a detailed view into the development process and makes it easier for users and contributors to see precisely what notable changes have been made between each release (or version) of the package. Whereas the [README](#readme) is designed for ___new___ users, the changelog is designed to for ___existing___ users. 

## What to log

The changelog should contain an entry for every single version release of the package and contain the following information:

* Release version and date of release
* New features __added__
* __Changes__ in existing functionality
* __Deprecated__ functionality (features/functionality that soon-to-be removed)
* __Removed__ functionality
* Bug __fixes__

## What not to do

### Commit log diffs

Using commit log diffs as changelogs is a bad idea: they're full of noise. Things like merge commits, commits with obscure titles, documentation changes, etc. The purpose of a commit is to document a step in the evolution of the source code. Some projects clean up commits, some don't. The purpose of a changelog entry is to document the noteworthy difference, often across multiple commits, to communicate them clearly to end users.

### Ignoring deprecations

When people upgrade from one version to another, it should be painfully clear when something will break. If you do nothing else, list deprecations, removals, and any breaking changes in your changelog. For other developers, it should be very clear to upgrade to a version that lists deprecations, remove what's deprecated, then upgrade to the version where the deprecations become removals.


## How to log

The changelog is typically contained in a file named `CHANGELOG`, `NEWS`, `RELEASES`, or `HISTORY` and is most commonly a `.md` or `.rst` file. We recommend you use `CHANGELOG.md` for `r fontawesome::fa("python")` packages and `NEWS.md` for `r fontawesome::fa("r-project")` since this is common convention.

```{block, type = "tip"}
The template you used to create your first package alread includes a changelog (`CHANGELOG.md` for Python and `NEWS.md` for R. However, in R you can use `usethis::use_news_md()` to automatically create a `NEWS.md` file if ones does not already exist. 
```


The changelog should be written in a manner that makes it easy to see certain types of changes made. It should be in reverse chronological order meaning the latest version comes first and the release version and date should be displayed. It is common to keep an `Unreleased` section at the top to track upcoming changes until you have determined the appropriate version bump. How you capture the important changes in the version can vary but the below is a good approach where you use common headings to capture types of changes:

- `Added`
- `Changed`
- `Deprecated`
- `Removed`
- `Fixed`
- `Refactor`

If an item is related to an issue in GitHub, include the issue number in parentheses, e.g. (#10). If an item is related to a pull request, include the pull request number and the author, e.g. (#101, \@bradleyboehmke). Doing this makes it easy to navigate to the relevant issues on GitHub.

__Example__:

```
# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Exercises

Both the `r fontawesome::fa("r-project")` and `r fontawesome::fa("python")` package templates include a changelog file. 

1. The [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) package is known for very detailed release notes. You can read them [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/whatsnew/index.html) and see the source code [here](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/tree/master/doc/source/whatsnew). What are 3 unique attributes about Pandas' approach to documenting changes?
2. Go to your `r fontawesome::fa("r-project")` and/or `r fontawesome::fa("python")` package and check out the existing changelog.
3. Add appropriate sections within the current version you are working to capture the features __added__ and any other changes you have made.
